# Deep JavaScript Foundation Notes

*Necessay notes while watching and practicing JavaScript from Kyle Simpson's JavaScript Foundation Course* 



- *Everything is objct in JavaScript* is **wrong**. There are seven primitive types:
    - Undefined
    - NULL
    - Boolean
    - Number
    - String
    - Object
    - Symbol
- JavaScript refers `function` as a subtype of a `object` type
- `Array` can be referred to as subtype of `object` type
- `BigInt` is a built-in object used to represent numbers grater than 2^53 - 1 ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt))
- Unlike C++/Java etc. In JavaScript, variables don't have types, values do.
